# Dungeon And Dungeons

A cozy, replayable text-based roguelike written in a single Python file.

You wake in a dark cramped dungeon and must work your way through 12 unpredictable rooms each room contains 3–5 randomized encounters monsters traps puzzles mimics merchants and shrines so every run feels different manage your gear and consumables survive poison and curses level up, and try to make it out alive

### ⚠ CAUTION:

The game will remain (text based) only and i'll not be adding a user interface this will be the final version if i change anything it will be in the values of the elements or the addition of more puzzles and enemies

## Highlights

- Single-file Python game: simple to read, modify, and run.
- Turn-based combat with weapons, armor, consumables, and status effects (poison, curse, lifesteal, etc.).
- 12 handcrafted room types with randomized encounter sequences for high replayability.
- Colorful ANSI terminal output for atmosphere and flavor text.
- Easy to extend: add monsters, items, or rooms in the main file.

## Quick start

Requirements: Python 3.8+ (any modern Python 3 will work).

Run the game from the project folder:

```bash
python game_v1.90.py
```

Follow on-screen prompts. Typical inputs are numeric menu choices and simple `y/n` answers.

## Controls / Gameplay

- During exploration and combat you choose numbered options (e.g., `1` Attack, `2` Use Item, `3` Flee).
- When picking up weapons/armor you are asked whether to equip them (`y/n`).
- Use the in-game shop on certain rooms to buy supplies with gold.
